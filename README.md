# Angular 2 Starter

> Angular 2 is still in Alpha stage, please don't use this in production

### Installation
You need these:
- Node with npm
- Bower
- Gulp

after you have them, just run:
```
npm install
```
It will also run `bower install` after the npm install done

### Start
Let's start up the server
```
gulp
```
or
```
gulp serve-dev
```

and done! Now you can start trying Angular 2!
Every changes to the file will refresh the browser automatically
and it'll also compile your changed TypeScripts files to Javascript files.
